<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To determine if postoperative topical cyclosporine 0.05% has any beneficial effect following trabeculectomy.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">This was an interventional, randomized, prospective, double-masked clinical trial of 44 consecutive <p>patients</p> with uncontrolled glaucoma requiring filtration surgery. Ocular surface disease index questionnaire and comprehensive ocular exam, including Schirmer's tear test 1, were performed. Patients underwent routine trabeculectomy, with or without phacoemulsification. The study group (n = 22) received <a1>cyclosporine</a1> 0.05%, and the control group (n = 22) received artificial <a2>tears</a2>. Patients were evaluated at 1 and 6 months post surgery. Outcome measures were intraocular <oc>pressure</oc>, success rate, bleb appearance, ocular surface disease index, Schirmer's tear test 1 and conjunctival inflammation.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Thirty-nine patients completed the study (19 in the study group, 20 in the control group). The mean baseline intraocular pressure was 23.8 +/- 12.6 mmHg in the study group and 25.9 +/- 10.6 mmHg in the control group (P = 0.513). Mean intraocular pressure at postoperative month 6 was <r1>14.88 +/- 6.2</r1> and <r2>14.62 +/- 5.46 mmHg</r2> in the study group and control group, respectively (P = 0.837). There was no statistically significant difference in the mean values of Schirmer's tear test 1 and the level of conjunctival hyperaemia between the two groups at baseline, months 1 and 6 post surgery. The treatment group had a statistically significant decrease in ocular surface disease index score at 6 months (P = 0.003), indicating less severity of dry eye symptoms and significant reduction in ocular pain.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Topical cyclosporine 0.05% had no effect on postoperative bleb function and intraocular pressure following trabeculectomy, but improved subjective ocular surface symptoms in these patients.</abstracttext>
