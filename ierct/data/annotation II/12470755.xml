<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effect and safety of latanoprost 0.005% once daily with that of unoprostone 0.15% twice daily for <p>patients</p> with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">Randomized clinical trial.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">In a prospective, 8-week, investigator-masked, parallel-group study conducted at numerous centers in the United States, 165 previously treated patients with IOP &gt;or= 25 mm Hg in one or both eyes after washout were randomly assigned to receive either <a1>latanoprost</a1> 0.005% once daily in the evening or <a2>unoprostone</a2> 0.15% twice daily. Observations procedures were Goldmann applanation tonometry, best-corrected visual acuity, slit lamp biomicroscopy, and ophthalmoscopy. The main outcome measure was <oc>change</oc> in the mean of the IOPs measured at 8:00 AM, 12 noon, and 4:00 PM between baseline (before treatment) and after 8 weeks of treatment.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">The change in the mean +/- SD of the IOPs measured at 8:00 AM, 12 noon, and 4:00 PM was <r1>-7.2 +/- 3.2 mm Hg</r1> (28%) for latanoprost (25.3 +/- 2.8 mm Hg at baseline to 18.2 +/- 2.8 mm Hg at 8 weeks) and <r2>-3.9 +/- 2.6 mm Hg</r2> (15%) for unoprostone (25.5 +/- 3.3 mm Hg at baseline to 21.6 +/- 4.0 mm Hg; P &lt;or=.001. No serious adverse event related to either medication was reported.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Over an 8-week period, latanoprost 0.005% once daily lowered IOP more than unoprostone 0.15% twice daily in patients with elevated IOP. Both agents were safe and well tolerated.</abstracttext>
