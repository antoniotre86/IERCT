<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">Carteolol is a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Used topically to reduce intraocular pressure, it is typically applied twice daily. In an effort to provide a once-daily dosing regimen, carteolol was formulated with 1% alginic acid. Sodium alginate is a natural polymer product with bioadhesive properties providing increased corneal contact time and a better carteolol penetration through the cornea. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-acting 1% carteolol alginate solution compared to standard 1% carteolol solution.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">This was a double-masked, parallel group, multicentre study. <p>Patients</p> with ocular hypertension or open angle glaucoma (n=151) were randomly assigned to receive either 1% <a1>carteolol</a1> alginate once daily (AM) or standard 1% <a2>carteolol</a2> solution twice daily for 2 months. The masking was maintained through the use of a placebo in the evening for the alginate group. Entry into the study required unmedicated intraocular pressure (IOP) between 23 mmHg and 32 mmHg at 9 AM and 11 AM. Patients using ocular hypotensive medication were required to undergo a washout. All patients provided written informed consent. Excluded from the study were patients with angle closure, congenital, secondary glaucoma or advanced glaucoma; any intraocular infection or inflammation, ocular trauma, ocular surgery or laser trabeculoplasty within the previous 3 months; contraindications to the use of beta adrenoceptor antagonists; systemic medications likely to modify IOP prescribed or modified during the previous 3 months; ocular steroid use; contact lens wear; and pregnant and lactating women. Patients were evaluated at baseline, 15 and 60 days, with IOP measurements at 9 AM and 11 AM. At day 15 and day 60, IOP was measured just before instillation of medication (9 AM) and 2 hours after (11 AM). Slit lamp examinations were performed at each follow-up examination, together with measurement of heart rate and blood pressure (10 AM) and ocular tolerance after medication (11 AM). The primary efficacy criterion was the <oc>decrease</oc> in IOP from baseline at day 60 for each measurement at 9 AM and 11 AM. The study eye was the eye with the higher IOP at day 0 or, if equal, the right eye.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Efficacy-of the 151 patients included in the study, 149 were evaluated (two patients were lost to follow-up after day 0): 74 in the alginate group and 75 in the standard group. Both treatment groups were comparable at day 0 except for sex, diastolic blood pressure, and IOP in the fellow eye. At 09.00 hours (presumed trough) on day 60, mean reductions from baseline in intraocular pressure were <r1>6.32+/-2.87</r1> and <r2>5.67+/-3.30 mmHg</r2> for the alginate carteolol and standard groups, respectively. At 11.00 hours (presumed peak), mean reductions were 6.70+/-2.81 and 6.55+/-3.35 mmHg, respectively. At each evaluation time, the two unilateral t tests were highly significant (p&lt;0.005), confirming the equivalence of both treatments. Conclusions were not modified taking into account sex and diastolic blood pressure. Safety- Slight decreases in heart rate and blood pressure means were observed in both groups at follow-up visits with no significant difference between groups. Subjective tolerance upon instillation was judged good or very good at day 60 by 100% of alginate patients and by 98.7% of standard patients. Transient discomfort (mainly stinging or burning sensation) was reported by approximately 4% - 6% of patients in each treatment group at each visit. A blurred vision sensation was reported by 2 out of 74 patients of the alginate group. Among the 17 reported adverse events, three were assessed as drug-related: one vertigo, one superficial punctate keratitis in the alginate group and one decrease in blood pressure in the standard group. No serious adverse events were reported.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">The new alginate formulation of long-acting carteolol 1% given once daily is as effective as standard 1% carteolol given twice daily, with no meaningful differences regarding safety. This efficacy wasy was verified at 9 AM (24 hours after the last drop of long-acting carteolol or 12 hours after that of standard carteolol) and at 11 AM (2 hours after the morning drop). The new alginate formulation of long-acting carteolol 1% given once a day is effective and well tolerated by glaucoma patients who require chronic treatment.</abstracttext>
