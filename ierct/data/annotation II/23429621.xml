<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the efficacy of bimatoprost/timolol (BTFC) or travoprost/timolol (TTFC) fixed combinations on intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction in an Egyptian population.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS"><p>Patients</p> with primary open angle glaucoma were randomized to receive either <a1>BTFC</a1> or <a2>TTFC</a2>. IOPs were measured at baseline, 2 weeks, and 1, 2, 4, and 6 months. The primary outcome measure was the mean <oc>change</oc> in IOP from baseline at each visit. Secondary outcome measures included the incidence of adverse events.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Eighty patients (80 eyes) were included finally: 40 eyes in each group. Baseline mean IOPs were 24.78Â±3.53 and 25.26Â±3.51 mm Hg for BTFC and TTFC, respectively (P=0.344). Both drops provided statistically significant IOP reductions from baseline at all visits (P&lt;0.001). BTFC provided greater significant mean IOP reductions from baseline than TTFC at each visit (P&lt;0.001). Mean IOP reductions were <r1>11.34</r1> and <r2>6.42 mm Hg</r2> at 2 weeks (P=0.000), and 11.17 and 7.89 mmâ€‰Hg at 6 months (P=0.001) for BTFC and TTFC, respectively. IOPs at 2 weeks were â‰¤18 mm Hg in 36 (90.8%) versus 22 (55%) eyes and â‰¤16 mm Hg in 28 (70%) versus 16 (40%) eyes (P&lt;0.001), and at 6 months, â‰¤18 mm Hg in 38 (95%) versus 28 (70%) eyes and â‰¤16 mm Hg in 30 (75%) versus 18 (45%) eyes for BTFC and TTFC, respectively (P&lt;0.001).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Both drops provided effective IOP reduction that was greater and patients were more likely to achieve lower target pressures with BTFC than with TTFC.</abstracttext>
