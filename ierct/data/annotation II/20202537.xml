<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare phacoemulsification alone and phacoemulsification with micro-bypass stent implantation in <p>eyes</p> with primary open-angle glaucoma.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="SETTING" nlmcategory="METHODS">Instituto di Fisiopatologia Clinica, Clinica Oculistica, Universita' di Torino, Torino, Italy.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">In this prospective double-masked randomized clinical trial, patients had <a1>phacoemulsification</a1> alone (control group) or <a2>phacoemulsification</a2> with iStent implantation (combined group). Primary outcomes were intraocular <oc>pressure</oc> (IOP) and reduction in medication use over 15 months and IOP after a 1-month washout of ocular hypotensive agents (ie, 16 months postoperatively).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">The baseline IOP was similar between groups (combined group: 17.9 mm Hg +/- 2.6 [SD]; control group: 17.3 +/- 3.0 mm Hg) (P = .512). Three patients in the control group were lost to follow-up. The mean IOP was <r2>14.8 +/- 1.2 mm Hg</r2> in the combined group and <r1>15.7 +/- 1.1 mm Hg</r1> in the control group at 15 months and 16.6 +/- 3.1 mm Hg and 19.2 +/- 3.5 mm Hg, respectively, after washout; the IOP was statistically significantly lower in the combined group than in the control group at both time points (P = .031 and P = .042, respectively). At 15 months, the mean number of medications was lower in the combined group than in the control group (0.4 +/- 0.7 and 1.3 +/- 1.0, respectively; P = .007), as was the proportion of patients on ocular hypotensive medication (33% and 76%, respectively).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Phacoemulsification with stent implantation was more effective in controlling IOP than phacoemulsification alone; the safety profiles were similar.</abstracttext>
