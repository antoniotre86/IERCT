<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the ocular hypotensive efficacy and safety of topical bimatoprost and timolol-dorzolamide combination in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension during 6 months of treatment.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">A sample of 65 <p>patients</p> with a diagnosis of POAG or ocular hypertension were randomized to receive either <a1>bimatoprost</a1> 0.03% once daily or timolol-dorzolamide <a2>combination</a2> twice daily. Study visits occurred at baseline and after 2 weeks and 1, 3 and 6 months of therapy. Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed at 12.00 hours at all study visits and also at 08.00 hours and 16.00 hours at baseline and 6-month visits. At each visit, local and systemic side-effects that occurred during the treatment period were recorded. Student's t-test was used to compare the differences between IOP values.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Differences in IOP between the bimatoprost and timolol-dorzolamide groups were statistically insignificant at all study visits (p &gt; 0.05). In the bimatoprost-treated group, the IOP <oc>reduction</oc> was <r1>6.2 +/- 1.8 mmHg</r1>, whereas it was <r2>6.5 +/- 2.3 mmHg</r2> in the timolol-dorzolamide group after 6 months of treatment. The difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.48).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">The IOP-lowering efficacies of bimatoprost and timolol-dorzolamide combination were similar over a 6-month follow-up. Both bimatoprost and the timolol-dorzolamide combination were well tolerated. Bimatoprost can be used as a longterm monotherapy agent in the treatment of POAG and ocular hypertension.</abstracttext>
