<abstracttext label="BACKGROUND" nlmcategory="BACKGROUND">The Baerveldt glaucoma implant is a large equatorial aqueous shunting device that is installed through a single-quadrant conjunctival incision. The intermediate-term results of a randomized study comparing the 350- and 500-mm2 Baerveldt implants are reported.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">Seventy-three <p>patients</p> with medically uncontrollable, nonneovascular glaucomas associated with aphakia, pseudophakia, or failed filters were enrolled in a randomized, prospective study comparing <a1>350-</a1> and <a2>500-mm2</a2> Baerveldt implants. Surgical success was defined as 6 mmHg &lt; or = final intraocular <oc>pressure</oc> &lt; or = 21 mmHg without glaucoma reoperation or devastating complication.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Of patients with 350- and 500-mm2 implants, <r1>93%</r1> and <r2>88%</r2>, respectively, achieved surgical success (18-month life-table analysis, P = 0.93). The 500-mm2 implants afforded intraocular pressure control with significantly fewer medications (0.7 versus 1.3; P = 0.006). The postoperative visual acuities remained within one line of the preoperative visual acuities or improved in 62% and 66% of patients in the 350- and 500-mm2 groups, respectively (P = 0.93). Complication rates were statistically similar. The most frequent ones in the 350- and 500-mm2 groups, respectively, were serous choroidal effusion (16% and 32%), strabismus (16% and 19%), anterior uveitis (14% and 11%), and corneal or corneal graft edema (11% each).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">The intermediate-term results of the 350- and 500-mm2 Baerveldt implants were statistically comparable with respect to surgical and visual outcomes, as well as complications, although the larger implant was associated with a higher rate of some complications. However, the 500-mm2 Baerveldt implant afforded intraocular pressure control with fewer medications than the 350-mm2 implant.</abstracttext>
