<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the efficacy and safety of laser peripheral iridotomy with or without laser peripheral iridoplasty in the treatment of eyes with synechial primary angle-closure or primary angle-closure glaucoma.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">Randomized, controlled clinical trial.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">Consecutive <p>patients</p> older than 40 years with synechial primary angle-closure or primary angle closure glaucoma were recruited. Eligible patients were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment options, <a1>iridotomy</a1> or <a2>iridotomy</a2> plus iridoplasty, and were followed up for 1 year. Main outcome measures were intraocular <oc>pressure</oc> (IOP), peripheral anterior synechiae, corneal endothelial cell count, and complications.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Seventy-seven eyes (77 patients) were randomized to the iridotomy group, and 81 eyes (81 patients) were randomized to the iridotomy plus iridoplasty group. Sixty-one patients (79.2%) in the iridotomy and 65 patients (80.2%) from the iridotomy plus iridoplasty groups completed 1 year of follow-up. There were no significant differences between the groups in the baseline data. IOP was reduced from 24.66 +/- 13.76 mm Hg to <r1>19.03 +/- 6.21 mm Hg</r1> in the iridotomy group (P &lt; .001) and from 27.96 +/- 13.06 mm Hg to <r2>20.45 +/- 7.26 mm Hg</r2> in the iridotomy plus iridoplasty group (P &lt; .001). Extent of peripheral anterior synechiae was decreased by 1 more clock-hour after iridoplasty compared with that after iridotomy in the iridotomy plus iridoplasty group (P &lt; .001). There was no significant difference in IOP, medications, need for surgery, or visual function between groups at the 1-year visit.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">In eyes with synechial primary angle-closure or primary angle-closure glaucoma, both iridotomy alone or combined with iridoplasty provide a significant and equivalent reduction in IOP. There is also a possible reduction in peripheral anterior synechiae, more so in the iridoplasty group.</abstracttext>
