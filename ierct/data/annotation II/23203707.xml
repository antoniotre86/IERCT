<abstracttext label="AIM" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare efficacy (intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction) and safety of preservative-free latanoprost (T2345) to benzalkonium chloride (BAK)-preserved latanoprost (BPL; Xalatan) in ocular hypertension (OHT) or primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) patients.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">Prospective, international, multicentre, randomised, investigator-masked, parallel-group trial. After a wash-out period, POAG or OHT <p>patients</p>, previously managed by BPL monotherapy, randomly received <a1>T2345</a1> or <a2>BPL</a2> (one drop into the affected eye(s)) once daily from D0 to D84. <oc>Change</oc> in IOP was measured at 09:00 (Â±1 h) from D0 to D84 in the worse eye.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Mean IOP reduction (D0-D84) was <r1>-8.6Â±2.6 mm Hg</r1> (-36%) on T2345 and <r2>-9.0Â±2.4 mm Hg</r2> (-38%) on BPL, confirming non-inferiority of T2345 to BPL. Non-inferiority of T2345 was observed from D15. The most frequent ocular adverse event, drug intolerance, was reported in 1 (0.5%) patient on T2345 versus 4 (2.1%) patients on BPL. Moderate to severe conjunctival hyperaemia was less frequent on T2345 than on BPL at D42 (20.2% vs 30.6%; p=0.003) and D84 (21.4% vs 29.1%; p=0.02). Upon instillation, the global subjective ocular symptom score was significantly lower on T2345 than BPL on D42 (0.15 vs 0.41; p=0.001) and D84 (0.18 vs 0.46; p=0.001).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Preservative-free latanoprost has the same efficacy as BPL, with improved local tolerance.</abstracttext>
