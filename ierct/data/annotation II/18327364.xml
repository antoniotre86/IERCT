<abstracttext label="OBJECTIVE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">Efficacy of the latanoprost versus timolol/dorzolamide combination therapy in <p>patients</p> with primary open angle glaucoma</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">The study was designed as a 6 months randomized, observer-masked study comprising 120 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma in Feiz Hospital, Isfahan, Iran, from 2006 to 2007. The patients were randomized (latanoprost, n = 60; dorzolamide/timolol, n = 60) to treatment with either <a1>latanoprost</a1>, 0.005% once daily, or the <a2>combination</a2> of timolol 0.5% twice daily, and dorzolamide 2% 3 times daily. The mean intraocular <oc>pressure</oc> (IOP) after one, 3, and 6 months of treatment was compared with baseline in the 2 groups.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">A total of 120 patients were randomized to 2 equal treatment groups. The mean baseline IOP values were similar between the 2 groups. The mean (standard error of mean [SE]) IOP reductions at months one was <r1>7.2</r1> (0.4), at month 3 was 7.3 (0.4), and at month 6 was 7.1 (0.3) mm Hg for the latanoprost group and <r2>7.5</r2> (0.3), 7.8 (0.3), and 7.4 (0.3) mm Hg for the dorzolamide/timolol group. The 2 therapies were similarly effective.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">The latanoprost and dorzolamide/timolol combination were equally effective at lowering IOP compared to untreated baseline.</abstracttext>
