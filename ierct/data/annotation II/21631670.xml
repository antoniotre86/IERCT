<abstracttext label="BACKGROUND" nlmcategory="BACKGROUND">To determine the effect of scleral flap size on the medium-term intraocular pressure control and complication rates after augmented trabeculectomy.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">Prospective randomized clinical trial.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="PARTICIPANTS" nlmcategory="METHODS">Glaucoma <p>patients</p> undergoing primary trabeculectomy. Exclusion criteria included previous ocular surgery apart from cataract surgery, secondary glaucoma and age under 18.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">Patients were randomized to either standard <a1>trabeculectomy</a1> (4 × 4 mm scleral flap) or <a2>microtrabeculectomy</a2> (2 × 2 mm scleral flap), both with adjustable sutures and antimetabolites. Bleb needling was performed as required. Patients were evaluated at day 1, weeks 1, 3, 6 and months 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 postoperatively.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES" nlmcategory="METHODS">Vision, intraocular <oc>pressure</oc>, complications and failure (intraocular pressure ≥ 21 mmHg or not reduced by ≥20% from baseline, intraocular pressure ≤ 5 mmHg, repeat glaucoma surgery and no light perception vision).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS"> Forty-one patients were recruited; 20 had standard trabeculectomy, and 21 had microtrabeculectomy. At 2 years, the mean intraocular pressure and cumulative probability of failure was <r1>12.4 ± 4.6 mmHg</r1> and 0.28 for standard trabeculectomy, and <r2>11.5 ± 3.6 mmHg</r2> and 0.27 for microtrabeculectomy (P = 0.50 and 0.89, respectively). One patient in each group required Baerveldt device implantation. Vision reduced ≥2 Snellen lines in 15% in the standard trabeculectomy group and 25% in the microtrabeculectomy group, mainly from cataract (P = 0.48).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Both trabeculectomy techniques achieved good intraocular pressure reduction and had similar complication rates. Scleral flap size had no significant effect on medium-term intraocular pressure control and complication profile.</abstracttext>
