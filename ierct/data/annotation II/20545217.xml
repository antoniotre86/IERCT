<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the efficacy and safety of 0.0015% tafluprost ophthalmic solution (Tafluprost) with Placebo ophthalmic solution (Placebo) in normal tension glaucoma (NTG).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="SETTING" nlmcategory="METHODS">Total of 94 patients enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group and multicenter study.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHOD" nlmcategory="METHODS"><p>Patients</p> with NTG were randomly assigned to either <a1>Tafluprost</a1> or <a2>Placebo</a2>. Both ophthalmic solutions were instilled once a day in the morning for 4 weeks.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Mean intraocular pressure (IOP) <oc>changes</oc> from baseline were <r1>-4.0 +/- 1.7 mmHg</r1> in Tafluprost administered patients and <r2>-1.4 +/- 1.8 mmHg</r2> in Placebo administered patients at 4 weeks, with a statistically significant difference (p&lt;0.001). IOP change at 4 weeks, % IOP reduction at 2 and 4 weeks were also significantly greater in Tafluprost than in Placebo. A total of 51.0% in Tafluprost treated group and 8.9% in Placebo treated group reported adverse drug reactions.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">These results indicate that Tafluprost is clinically useful in the treatment of NTG.</abstracttext>
