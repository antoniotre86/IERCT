<abstracttext label="OBJECTIVE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare phacoemulsification versus trabeculectomy with adjunctive mitomycin C in medically uncontrolled chronic angle-closure glaucoma (CACG) without cataract.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">Prospective, randomized clinical trial.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="PARTICIPANTS" nlmcategory="METHODS">Fifty medically uncontrolled CACG <p>eyes</p> without cataract of 50 patients.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="INTERVENTION" nlmcategory="METHODS">Patients were randomized into undergoing either <a1>phacoemulsification</a1> or <a2>trabeculectomy</a2> with adjunctive mitomycin C. After surgery, patients were followed up every 3 months for 2 years.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES" nlmcategory="METHODS">Intraocular <oc>pressure</oc> (IOP) and requirement for glaucoma drugs.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Twenty-six CACG eyes were randomized to receive phacoemulsification, and 24 eyes underwent trabeculectomy with mitomycin C. Phacoemulsification and trabeculectomy resulted in significant and comparable IOP reduction at 24 months after surgery (reduction of <r1>8.4 mmHg</r1> or 34% for phacoemulsification vs <r2>8.9 mmHg</r2> or 36% for trabeculectomy; P=0.76). Over first 24 months, trabeculectomy-treated eyes required on average 1.1 fewer drugs than phacoemulsification-treated eyes (P&lt;0.001). However, trabeculectomy was associated with significantly more surgical complications than phacoemulsification (46% vs. 4%; P=0.001). Eight (33%) of 24 trabeculectomy eyes demonstrated cataract during follow-up.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Both phacoemulsification and trabeculectomy are effective in reducing IOP in medically uncontrolled CACG eyes without cataract. Trabeculectomy is more effective than phacoemulsification in reducing dependence on glaucoma drugs, but is associated with more complications.</abstracttext>
