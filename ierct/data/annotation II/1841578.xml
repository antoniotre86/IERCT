<abstracttext>We conducted a prospective, randomized study to compare mitomycin with fluorouracil for efficacy and safety as an adjunct to trabeculectomy in <p>eyes</p> with glaucoma with poor surgical prognosis. Thirty-two eyes of 32 patients were randomly allocated to either <a1>mitomycin</a1> (17 eyes) or <a2>fluorouracil</a2> therapy (15 eyes). Mitomycin (0.2 mg) was applied only once during trabeculectomy, and fluorouracil (5 mg) was subconjunctivally injected 10 times in the 2 weeks after surgery. Fifteen eyes (<r1>88%</r1>) in the mitomycin group and seven (<r2>47%</r2>) in the fluorouracil group achieved an intraocular <oc>pressure</oc> of less than or equal to 20 mm Hg without antiglaucoma medication. The follow-up period was 7 to 12 months. Corneal complications were less common in the group given mitomycin than in that given fluorouracil (12% vs 53%). The incidence of other complications was similar between the two groups.</abstracttext>
