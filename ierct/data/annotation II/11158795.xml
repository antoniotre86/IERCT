<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare viscocanalostomy, a nonpenetrating procedure for glaucoma treatment, with trabeculectomy.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">Randomized controlled trial.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="PARTICIPANTS" nlmcategory="METHODS">Twenty white <p>subjects</p> (20 eyes) with open-angle glaucoma with no history of surgery were enrolled.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">Ten subjects were randomly assigned to <a1>viscocanalostomy</a1> according to Stegmann's technique and 10 subjects to a modified Cairns <a2>trabeculectomy</a2>. A complete ophthalmologic examination was performed the day before surgery and postoperatively. Further visits were scheduled monthly for 6 to 8 months after surgery.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES" nlmcategory="METHODS">Success was defined as intraocular <oc>pressure</oc> (IOP) between 7 and 20 mmHg, with no medication.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">After a mean follow-up of 6 months (range, 6-8 months), success was obtained in <r1>5 of 10</r1> cases in the trabeculectomy group and in <r2>0 of 10</r2> case in the viscocanalostomy group. With Kaplan-Meier's method, subjects with viscocanalostomy showed shorter postoperative IOP-reduction periods than subjects undergoing trabeculectomy.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">According to the results of this short-term study, trabeculectomy was more effective than viscocanalostomy in lowering IOP in glaucomatous eyes of white patients.</abstracttext>
