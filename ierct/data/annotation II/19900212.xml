<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the effect of time on therapy, efficacy, tolerability and resource utilization of latanoprost or non-prostaglandin analogues (non-PGs) in patients who required a change in intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering monotherapy.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">This open-label, multicentre study (Sweden, 19 sites; Finland, seven sites) included <p>adults</p> with glaucoma or ocular hypertension with mean diurnal IOP &gt; or = 21 mmHg on ocular hypotensive monotherapy. Patients were randomized to <a1>latanoprost</a1> monotherapy or <a2>non-PG</a2> therapy (commercially available therapy other than a PG) and followed for 36 months. End-points included: time to treatment <oc>failure</oc> (baseline to visit with a change in/addition to treatment); diurnal IOP (mean of 08.00, 12.00 and 16:00 hr measurements) at months 6, 12, 24 and 36; tolerability; and resource utilization, where analyses used Swedish and Finnish 2006 unit costs.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Three hundred and twenty-six patients received &gt;or = 1 dose of latanoprost (n = 162) or non-PGs (n = 164). Median time to treatment failure was longer for latanoprost (<r1>36</r1> months) than for non-PGs (<r2>12</r2> months; p &lt; 0.001); 51% and 24% of patients remained on randomized therapy after 36 months, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). Decreases in mean diurnal IOP from baseline were significantly greater for latanoprost than for non-PGs at months 6 and 12 (p &lt; 0.01). No serious adverse events were judged to be treatment-related. Mean total 36-month direct costs were similar in patients initiated with latanoprost and non-PGs.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Patients who failed previous monotherapy remained on therapy longer when switched to latanoprost. Latanoprost's IOP-reducing effect and tolerability were sustained over the long term. Resource utilization and costs were generally similar in those initiating latanoprost or non-PG therapy.</abstracttext>
