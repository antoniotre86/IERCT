<abstracttext label="INTRODUCTION" nlmcategory="BACKGROUND">The purpose of this study was to establish the efficacy and safety of the Ex-PRESS (Optonol Ltd., Neve Ilan, Israel) mini glaucoma shunt in open-angle <p>glaucoma</p>.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">This was a prospective, randomized trial. Eyes from enrolled patients were randomly assigned to either <a1>Ex-PRESS</a1> implantation under a scleral flap, or <a2>trabeculectomy</a2>. The main outcome measures were: mean intraocular pressure (IOP), postoperative medication use, visual acuity, and incidence of complications. Complete success was defined as an <oc>IOP</oc> of &gt;4 mmHg and &lt;or=18 mmHg without the use of antiglaucoma medications. A more stringent target of IOP &gt;4 mmHg and &lt;or=15 mmHg was also noted.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">There were 78 patients (80 eyes) with primary open-angle, pseudoexfoliative, or pigmentary glaucoma enrolled in the study. A total of <r1>84.6%</r1> of patients receiving Ex-PRESS and <r2>60.0%</r2> of patients receiving trabeculectomy (P=0.0230) achieved complete success. The respective proportions of patients achieving an IOP &gt;4 mmHg and &lt;or=15 mmHg were 76.9% and 50.0% (P=0.0193). At 1-year follow-up, complete success rates were 81.8% for Ex-PRESS and 47.5% for trabeculectomy (P=0.0020), and 71.7% and 37.5% (P=0.0070), respectively, for the more stringent target. There was a similar level of postoperative interventions and complications for each group.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">In open-angle glaucoma, the Ex-PRESS mini glaucoma shunt implanted under a superficial scleral flap produces significantly higher success rates, and a similar complication rate, compared with trabeculectomy. The Ex-PRESS is a safe and effective device for treating open-angle glaucoma.</abstracttext>
