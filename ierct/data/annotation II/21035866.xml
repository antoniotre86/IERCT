<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To test the hypothesis that neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) significantly reduces the incidence of conversion from pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS) with ocular hypertension (OHT) to pigmentary glaucoma (PG).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">Prospective, randomized, controlled 3-year trial.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="PARTICIPANTS" nlmcategory="METHODS">One hundred sixteen eyes of 116 <p>patients</p> with PDS and OHT.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="INTERVENTION" nlmcategory="METHODS">Patients were assigned randomly either to Nd:YAG <a1>LPI</a1> or to a <a2>control</a2> group (no laser).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES" nlmcategory="METHODS">The primary outcome measure was <oc>conversion</oc> to PG within 3 years, based on full-threshold visual field (VF) analysis using the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study criteria. Secondary outcome measures were whether eyes required topical antiglaucoma medications during the study period and the time to conversion or medication.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Fifty-seven patients were randomized to undergo laser treatment and 59 were randomized to no laser (controls). Age, gender, spherical equivalent refraction, and intraocular pressure at baseline were similar between groups. Outcome data were available for 105 (90%) of recruited subjects, 52 in the laser treatment group and 53 in the no laser treatment group. Patients were followed up for a median of 35.9 months (range, 10-36 months) in the laser arm and 35.9 months (range, 1-36 months) in the control arm. Eight eyes (<r1>15%</r1>) in the laser group and 3 eyes (<r2>6%</r2>) in the control group converted to glaucoma in the study period. The proportion of eyes started on medical treatment was similar in the 2 groups: 8 eyes (15%) in the laser group and 9 eyes (17%) in the control group. Survival analyses showed no evidence of any difference in time to VF progression or commencement of topical therapy between the 2 groups. Cataract extraction was performed on 1 patient in the laser group and in 1 patient in the control group during the study period (laser eye at 18 months; control eye at 34 months).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">This study suggests that there was no benefit of Nd:YAG LPI in preventing progression from PDS with OHT to PG within 3 years of follow-up.</abstracttext>
