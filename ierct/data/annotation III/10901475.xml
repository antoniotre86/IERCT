<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the additional intraocular pressure-lowering effect of <a1>latanoprost</a1> 0.005% administered once daily with that of <a2>pilocarpine</a2> 2% administered three times daily in <p>patients</p> with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension currently on monotherapy with timolol 0.5% twice daily.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">In a 6-month, multicenter, randomized, open-label study 242 patients with POAG or OH whose IOP was not controlled with timolol 0.5% b.i.d. were enrolled. Eyes had not been treated with pilocarpine and latanoprost for at least 2 years. An analysis of covariance with diurnal IOP change from baseline to month 6 for study eyes was performed.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Four patients on latanoprost 0.005% and 35 on pilocarpine 2% did not complete the study (P&lt;0.001). Two hundred and forty patients were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. For both treatments the diurnal IOP reduction after 6 months was statistically significant (P&lt;0.001). <oc>IOP</oc> (mean+/-SD) was reduced from 23.3+/-2.8 to <r1>17.8+/-2.8 (-5.6) mmHg</r1> in the latanoprost 0.005% group and from 23.0+/-3.2 to <r2>18.5+/-2.4 (-4.8) mmHg</r2> in pilocarpine 2% t.i.d.-treated eyes. The mean difference of -0.8 mmHg (per protocol, PP) and -1.6 mmHg (intend-to-treat, ITT) was statistically significant (P&lt;0.04, PP; P&lt;0.001, ITT) in favor of latanoprost 0.005%. Two eyes treated with latanoprost showed an iris color change. Thirty-six patients in the latanoprost group and 106 in the pilocarpine 2% group reported ocular adverse events (P&lt;0.001).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">From the data we conclude that the additivity of latanoprost 0.005% is at least as effective as pilocarpine 2% t.i.d. in reducing IOP when added to eyes currently on monotherapy with timolol 0.5% b.i.d. Latanoprost was better tolerated than pilocarpine 2% eye drops in this study. The increase in iris pigmentation requires further investigation.</abstracttext>
