<abstracttext label="OBJECTIVE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the efficacy of the <a1>Ahmed</a1> S2 Glaucoma Valve with the <a2>Baerveldt</a2> 250-mm(2) Glaucoma Implant in the treatment of adult glaucoma.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">Comparative case series.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="PARTICIPANTS" nlmcategory="METHODS">Fifty-nine eyes of 59 <p>patients</p> who received the Ahmed S2 Glaucoma Valve and 133 eyes of 133 patients who received the Baerveldt 250-mm(2) Glaucoma Implant by the Indiana University Glaucoma Service from 1996 to 2003.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">Eyes that had previous drainage implant procedures were excluded from both groups. If both eyes of a single patient received an implant, the second eye to undergo implantation was excluded from the study.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES" nlmcategory="METHODS">Kaplan-Meier survival with success defined as intraocular pressure (IOP) &gt; 5 mmHg and &lt; 22 mmHg and at least 20% reduction from preoperative IOP (with or without antiglaucoma medications) and without loss of light perception. Secondary outcome measures included intraocular pressure, visual acuity, number of glaucoma medications, and surgical complications.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">The 2 groups were similar with regards to age, gender, race, neovascular glaucoma diagnosis, number of prior ocular surgeries, preoperative IOP, and number of preoperative glaucoma medications. Mean durations of follow-up were 20.0 months for Ahmed eyes and 22.9 months for Baerveldt eyes. Cumulative <oc>successes</oc> in the Ahmed group were <r1>0.73</r1> at 1 year and 0.62 at 2 years, whereas cumulative successes in the Baerveldt group were <r2>0.92</r2> at 1 year and 0.85 at 2 years (Kaplan-Meier survival functions: P = 0.03, log rank test). Male gender, African descent, neovascular glaucoma, and Ahmed implantation were found to be significant predictors of failure. At last follow-up visit, eyes in the Ahmed group had a significantly higher mean IOP (19.8+/-9.5 vs. 15.8+/-7.9 mmHg, P = 0.003, t test) and more antiglaucoma medications (1.4+/-1.2 vs. 0.9+/-1.1 medications, P = 0.008, Mann-Whitney test) than eyes in the Baerveldt group. Two methods for avoiding hypotony after Baerveldt 250-mm(2) implantation had similar outcomes.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Our study suggests that the Ahmed S2 Glaucoma Valve may be less effective at lowering IOP than the Baerveldt 250-mm(2) Glaucoma Implant.</abstracttext>
