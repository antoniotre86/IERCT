<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intraoperative mitomycin C (MMC) in eyes undergoing Ahmed Glaucoma Valve implantation.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">Randomized controlled clinical trial.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="PARTICIPANTS" nlmcategory="METHODS">Sixty <p>patients</p> with refractory glaucoma.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="INTERVENTION" nlmcategory="METHODS">Sixty eyes of 60 patients with refractory glaucoma were randomized to receive intraoperative <a1>MMC</a1> (0.5 mg/ml for 5 minutes) (n = 34) or balanced salt <a2>solution</a2> (n = 26) during Ahmed Glaucoma Valve implantation.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES" nlmcategory="METHODS">Surgical success was defined according to 2 different criteria: (1) postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) between 6 and 21 mmHg, with or without antiglaucoma medications, and (2) IOP reduction of at least 30% relative to preoperative values. Eyes requiring additional glaucoma surgery, developing phthisis, or showing loss of light perception were classified as failures. Success rates in both groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the log rank test. Other outcome measures were mean IOP, number of glaucoma medications, and complications.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">After a mean follow-up of 12.3 months, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a <oc>probability</oc> of success of <r1>59%</r1> at 18 months for the MMC group and <r2>61%</r2> for the control group when the first criterion for success was used (IOP between 6 and 21 mmHg). When an IOP reduction of at least 30% was used as the criterion to define success, the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated a probability of success at 18 months of 62% for the MMC group and 67% for the control group. There were no significant differences in survival rates between the 2 groups with either criterion (P = 0.75 and P = 0.37, respectively). After 15 days postoperatively, the mean IOP did not significantly differ for both MMC and control eyes. Mean numbers of postoperative antiglaucoma medications were similar in MMC-treated eyes and controls. There was no significant difference between the incidences of postoperative complications in both groups.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Mitomycin C did not increase the short- or intermediate-term success rates of Ahmed Glaucoma Valve implantation.</abstracttext>
