<abstracttext label="OBJECTIVE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the IOP-lowering efficacy of a.m.-dosed <a1>travoprost</a1> and <a2>latanoprost</a2> at 24-h post-dose.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">Open-angle glaucoma <p>patients</p> not naïve to prostaglandin therapy and currently controlled on p.m.-dosed (2100) latanoprost (n = 21) or travoprost (n = 30) had baseline IOPs measured at 0900. In a randomized, single-masked, crossover design, patients received travoprost (Travatan † ) or latanoprost (Xalatan ‡ ) at 0900 for 4 weeks, then were crossed over to receive the second prostaglandin for another 4 weeks. Treatment IOP was measured at 0900 prior to morning dose at both 4 and 8 week visits. Patient dosing preference (a.m./p.m.) was surveyed on exit. Main outcome measure: Intraocular pressure (IOP). † Travatan is a registered trade name of Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX, USA ‡ Xalatan is a registered trade name of Pfizer, New York, NY, USA.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">The mean <oc>IOP</oc> in the first period when all patients were dosed in the evening was assessed 12 h after dosing at 09:00 and it was similar in the two treatment groups (mean +/- standard deviation: <r1>17.9 +/- 2.7 mmHg</r1> for travoprost versus <r2>17.7 +/- 2.5 mmHg</r2> for latanoprost, p = 0.812). In the a.m.-dosing crossover comparison, the 24-h post-dose IOP was significantly lower ( p &lt; 0.001) on travoprost (16.9 +/- 3.1 mmHg) compared to latanoprost (18.6 +/- 3.3 mmHg). In the exit survey, 51% of patients preferred a.m.-dosing.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">a.m.-dosed travoprost is superior to a.m.-dosed latanoprost by 1.7 mmHg at 24-h post-dose.</abstracttext>
