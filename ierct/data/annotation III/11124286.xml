<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To report a randomized clinical trial of postoperative subconjunctival injections of low-dose 5-fluorouracil in <p>patients</p> undergoing primary trabeculectomy.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">In a prospective, randomized clinical trial, 40 eyes of 40 patients were randomized to the low-dose <a1>5-fluorouracil</a1> group and received three subconjunctival injections of 5 mg each over 11 postoperative days, and 40 eyes of 40 patients were randomized to <a2>trabeculectomy</a2> without 5-fluorouracil.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Mean (+/-SD) preoperative and 1-year postoperative intraocular <oc>pressures</oc> in the 5-fluorouracil group were 26.9 (+/-9.5) and <r1>15.3 (+/-5.8) mm Hg</r1>, respectively. In the control group these were 25.9 (+/-8.1) mm Hg, and <r2>15.8 (+/-5.1) mm Hg</r2>, respectively. The patients who received 5-fluorouracil had a mean reduction in intraocular pressure of 11.5 (+/-9.1) mm Hg at a median follow-up of 52.3 weeks. The control group had a mean reduction in intraocular pressure of 10.2 (+/-8.7) mm Hg at a median follow-up of 52.6 weeks. These differences were not statistically significant.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Three postoperative subconjunctival 5-fluorouracil injections of 5 mg each after trabeculectomy in eyes at low risk for failure had no statistically or clinically significant effect on reduction of intraocular pressure with 1-year follow-up. Enhancement of success in this group of patients may require a larger total dose of 5-fluorouracil.</abstracttext>
