<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the efficacy of <a1>bimatoprost</a1> and <a2>travoprost</a2> on intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction in an Egyptian population.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS"><p>Patients</p> with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomized to receive either bimatoprost 0.03% or travoprost 0.004% once daily. IOPs were measured at baseline; 2 weeks; and 1, 2, 4, and 6 months using Goldman applanation tonometery.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Seventy-two patients were included: 34 and 38 (P=0.142) with a baseline mean IOP 26.52 ± 5.185 and 26.36 ± 1.605 mm Hg (P=0.629) for bimatoprost and travoprost, respectively. Both drops provided statistically significant IOP reductions from baseline at all visits (P&lt;0.001). Bimatoprost provided greater (nonsignificant) mean IOP reductions from baseline than travoprost at each visit. Mean IOP <oc>reduction</oc> was <r1>8.77 mm Hg</r1> (33.39%) and <r2>8.42 mm Hg</r2> (31.54%) at 2 weeks (P = 0.703), and 8.47 mm Hg (31.61%) and 7.84 mm Hg (29.50%) at 6 months (P = 0.536) for bimatoprost and travoprost, respectively. IOPs at 2 weeks were 18 mm Hg in 20 (58.8%) versus 19 (50%) eyes (P = 0.603), and 16 mm Hg in 12 (35%) versus 12 (32%) eyes (P = 0.456); and at 6 months 18 mm Hg in 22 (65%) versus 14 (37%) eyes (P = 0.045), and 16 mm Hg in 12 (35%) versus 7 (18%) eyes (P = 0.037) for bimatoprost and travoprost, respectively. Ocular adverse and clinical success occurred equally with both drops.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Both drops lowered IOP effectively but bimatoprost showed a greater non-significant reductions in mean IOP from baseline.</abstracttext>
