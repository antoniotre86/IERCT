<abstracttext label="BACKGROUND/AIMS" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering efficacy and side effects of <a1>latanoprost</a1> 0.005% and <a2>bimatoprost</a2> 0.03% in <p>subjects</p> with chronic primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">This was an observer-masked randomised crossover study of 60 PACG subjects who received either latanoprost or bimatoprost for 6 weeks, after which they were crossed over to the other medication for another 6 weeks. The IOP-reducing effect of the medications was assessed by the reduction in IOP after 6 weeks of treatment compared with baseline.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Fifty-four subjects (80 eyes) completed the study. Latanoprost reduced <oc>IOP</oc> (mean (SD)) by <r1>8.4 (3.8) mm Hg</r1> and bimatoprost by <r2>8.9 (3.9) mm Hg</r2> from a baseline of 25.2 (3.6) mm Hg and 25.2 (3.6) mm Hg respectively (p = 0.23). Adverse events were mild in both groups; however there were twice as many reports of an adverse event in the bimatoprost group (81%) compared with the latanoprost group (40%, p&lt;0.01). Ocular irritation was the most frequently reported adverse event in both groups; 22 subjects (37.9%) treated with bimatoprost experienced ocular hyperaemia as compared with 13 subjects (22.4%) treated with latanoprost (p = 0.11).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Bimatoprost once daily was similarly effective in reducing IOP compared with latanoprost once daily in subjects with chronic PACG. Both drugs were well tolerated with mild ocular adverse events.</abstracttext>
