<abstracttext label="AIM" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To verify the safety and efficacy of <a1>Ologen</a1> (OLO) implant as adjuvant compared with low-dosage <a2>mitomycin</a2>-C (MMC) in trabeculectomy.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">This was a prospective randomized clinical trial with a 24-month follow-up. Forty glaucoma <p>patients</p> (40 eyes) were assigned to trabeculectomy with MMC or OLO. Primary outcome includes target IOP at ≤21, ≤17, and ≤15 mm Hg; complete (target IOP without medications), and qualified success (target IOP regardless of medications). Secondary outcomes include bleb evaluation, according to Moorfields Bleb Grading System (MBGS); spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) examination; number of glaucoma medications; and frequency of postoperative adjunctive procedures and complications.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">The mean preoperative IOP was 26.5 (±5.2) in MMC and 27.3 (±6.0) in OLO eyes, without statistical significance. One-day postoperatively, the IOP dropped to 5.2 (±3.5) and 9.2 (±5.5) mm Hg, respectively (P=0.009). The IOP reduction was significant at end point in all groups (P=0.01), with a mean <oc>IOP</oc> of <r2>16.0 (±2.9)</r2> and <r1>16.5 (±2.1) mm Hg</r1> in MMC and OLO, respectively. The rates and Kaplan-Meier curves did not differ for both complete and qualified success at any target IOP. The bleb height in OLO group was higher than MMC one (P&lt;0.05). SD-OCT analysis of successful/unsuccessful bleb in patients with or without complete success at IOP =17  mm Hg indicated a sensitivity of 83% and 73% and a specificity of 75% and 67%, respectively, for MMC and OLO groups. No adverse reaction to OLO was noted.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Our results suggest that OLO implant could be a new, safe, and effective alternative to MMC, with similar long-term success rate.</abstracttext>
