<abstracttext label="INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">Bimatoprost and the fixed combination of latanoprost with timolol maleate are 2 medications widely used to treat glaucoma and ocular hypertension (OHT). The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of these 2 drugs in reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) after 8 weeks of treatment in <p>patients</p> with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or OHT.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">In this randomized, open-label trial, 44 patients with POAG or OHT were allocated to receive either <a1>bimatoprost</a1> (1 drop QD) or <a2>latanoprost/timolol</a2> (1 drop QD). Primary outcome was the mean diurnal IOP measurement at the 8th week, calculated as the mean IOP measurements taken at 8:00 am, 10:00 am, and 12:00 pm Secondary outcomes included the baseline change in IOP measured 3 times a day, after the water-drinking test (performed after the last IOP measurement), and the assessment of side effects of each therapy.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">The mean IOP <oc>levels</oc> of latanoprost/timolol (<r2>13.83</r2>, SD = 2.54) was significantly lower than of bimatoprost (<r1>16.16</r1>, SD = 3.28; P &lt; 0.0001) at week 8. Also, the change in mean IOP values was significantly higher in the latanoprost/timolol group at 10:00 am (P = 0.013) and 12:00 pm (P = 0.01), but not at 8:00 am (P = ns). During the water-drinking test, there was no significant difference in IOP increase (absolute and percentage) between groups; however, there was a significant decrease in mean heart rate in the latanoprost/timolol group. Finally, no significant changes in blood pressure and lung spirometry were observed in either groups.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">The fixed combination of latanoprost/timolol was significantly superior to bimatoprost alone in reducing IOP in patients with POAG or OHT. Further studies with large sample sizes should be taken to support the superior efficacy of latanoprost/timolol, as well as to better assess its profile of side effects.</abstracttext>
