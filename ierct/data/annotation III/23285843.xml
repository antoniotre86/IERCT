<abstracttext label="OBJECTIVE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effect and safety of topical <a1>brimonidine</a1> to that of <a2>timolol</a2>, and to study the additive effect of topical brimonidine to topical prostaglandin (PG) analogues in 475 <p>patients</p> with either ocular hypertension or primary open angle glaucoma.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">The primary endpoint was the mean IOP change from the baseline at 0 and 2 hours at week 4.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">The mean <oc>changes</oc> were <r2>-4.7 +/- 2.1</r2> (S. D.) in the timolol and <r1>-4.0 +/- 2.0 mmHg</r1> in the brimonidine group (p = 0.0138). The 95% confidence interval of the inter-group difference was greater than the pre-determined criterion of non-inferiority of brimonidine to timolol. When added to PG analogues, the IOP-lowering effect of brimonidine (-2.9 +/- 1.8 mmHg) was greater than that of the placebo (-2.1 +/- 1.8 mmHg) (p = 0.0010). No appreciable adverse side effects were encountered.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Topical brimonidine showed an additive IOP-lowering effect to topical PG analogues, although its IOP-lowering effect was inferior to topical timolol as monotherapy.</abstracttext>
