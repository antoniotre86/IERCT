<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the effectiveness and safety of excimer laser <a1>trabeculotomy</a1> (ELT) ab interno vs selective laser <a2>trabeculoplasty</a2> (SLT) over 24 months of follow-up in <p>patients</p> with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) refractory to medical therapy.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="PATIENTS AND METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">This prospective, randomized study included 30 consecutive eyes assigned randomly to either ELT or SLT group. ELT was carried out using a XeCl Excimer Laser with an emission wavelength of 308 nm. Eight spots were equally distributed at a distance of 500 microm from one another over the anterior trabeculum. The SLT patients were treated with a frequency-doubled q-switched neodymium:yytrium-aluminum-garnet laser (wavelength 532 nm). Approximately 50 adjacent, but not overlapping, laser spots were distributed over 180 degrees of the trabecular meshwork, using an energy level ranging from 0.7 to 1.0 mJ per pulse. The main outcome measure was intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering after ELT and SLT. Success was defined as &gt;or=20% reduction in IOP without further glaucoma intervention.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">At 24 months, complete success <oc>rates</oc> were <r1>53.3%</r1> for the ELT group and <r2>40%</r2> for the SLT group (P=0.35, Fisher's exact test); qualified success rates were 33.3% for the ELT and 26.6% for the SLT group (P=0.5, Fisher's exact test).Mean IOP decreased from 25.0+/-1.9 to 17.6+/-2.2 mmHg (-29.6%; P&lt;0.0001) in the ELT group and from 23.9+/-0.9 to 19.1+/-1.8 mmHg (-21%; P&lt;0.0001) in the SLT group.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Both ELT and SLT proved to be effective techniques in the treatment of POAG refractory to medical therapy.</abstracttext>
