<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the safety and efficacy of intraoperative <a1>5-fluorouracil</a1> (5-FU) or Intraoperative <a2>mitomycin</a2> C (MMC) in eyes undergoing primary trabeculectomy.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">Prospective double-masked randomized clinical trial.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">One hundred fifteen eyes of 103 <p>patients</p> with uncontrolled intraocular pressure (IOP) despite maximally tolerated medical therapy or laser were prospectively randomized in a double-masked fashion to one of two treatment groups in a single institution setting. Subject's eyes underwent primary trabeculectomy with either topical 5-FU (50 mg/ml for 5 minutes) or topical MMC (0.2 mg/ml for 2 minutes). Primary outcome measures included the number of eyes achieving target pressures of 21, 18, 15, and 12 mm Hg at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Secondary outcome measures included IOP, best-corrected visual acuity, complications, and interventions.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Of the 115 eyes, 57 received 5-FU while 58 received MMC. A target <oc>IOP</oc> of 21 mm Hg at 6 months was achieved in 53 of 56 (<r1>95%</r1>) eyes in the 5-FU group and 54 of 57 (<r2>95%</r2>) eyes in the MMC group (P = 1.00). At 12 months, 45 of 48 (94%) eyes in the 5-FU group met a target IOP of 21 mm Hg while 48 of 54 (89%) eyes in the MMC group did (P =.49). The most common complications in each group were persistent choroidal effusions and bleb leak.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Our study suggests that intraoperative topical 5-FU is at least as effective as intraoperative topical MMC in reducing IOP of eyes undergoing primary trabeculectomy.</abstracttext>
