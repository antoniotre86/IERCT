<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the alpha2-adrenergic agonist <a1>brimonidine</a1> tartrate 0.2% to the beta-adrenergic antagonist <a2>timolol</a2> maleate 0.5% in preserving visual function in low-pressure <p>glaucoma</p>.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">Randomized, double-masked, multicenter clinical trial.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">Exclusion criteria included untreated intraocular pressure (IOP) &gt;21 mm Hg, visual field mean deviation worse than -16 decibels, or contraindications to study medications. Both eyes received twice-daily monotherapy randomized in blocks of 7 (4 brimonidine to 3 timolol). Standard automated perimetry and tonometry were performed at 4-month intervals. Main outcome measure was field progression in either eye, defined as the same 3 or more points with a negative slope -1 dB/year at P&lt;5%, on 3 consecutive tests, assessed by pointwise linear regression. Secondary outcome measures were progression based on glaucoma change probability maps (GCPM) of pattern deviation and the 3-omitting method for pointwise linear regression.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Ninety-nine patients were randomized to brimonidine and 79 to timolol. Mean (+/- SE) months of follow-up for all patients was 30.0 +/- 2. Statistically fewer brimonidine-treated patients (9, <r1>9.1%</r1>) had visual field <oc>progression</oc> by pointwise linear regression than timolol-treated patients (31, <r2>39.2%</r2>, log-rank 12.4, P=.001). Mean treated IOP was similar for brimonidine- and timolol-treated patients at all time points. More brimonidine-treated (28, 28.3%) than timolol-treated (9, 11.4%) patients discontinued study participation because of drug-related adverse events (P=.008). Similar differences in progression were observed when analyzed by GCPM and the 3-omitting method.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Low-pressure glaucoma patients treated with brimonidine 0.2% who do not develop ocular allergy are less likely to have field progression than patients treated with timolol 0.5%.</abstracttext>
