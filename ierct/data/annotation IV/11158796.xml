<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the intraocular pressure (IOP) reducing effect and safety of <a1>latanoprost</a1> 0.005% once daily with <a2>unoprostone</a2> 0.12% twice daily in <p>patients</p> with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension (OH).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">An 8-week, double-masked, randomized, parallel-group, single-center clinical trial.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="PARTICIPANTS" nlmcategory="METHODS">A total of 108 <p>patients</p> with POAG or OH were enrolled.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="INTERVENTIONS" nlmcategory="METHODS">After completing a wash-out of ocular hypotensive medications, patients were randomized to receive either <a1>latanoprost</a1> once daily in the evening plus placebo once daily in the morning, or <a2>unoprostone</a2> twice daily (morning and evening).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES" nlmcategory="METHODS">IOP was measured at 10:00 AM and at 5:00 PM at baseline and at week 8, and before 12:00 noon at week 2. Ocular and systemic safety assessments were performed.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">From an overall baseline of 24.1 mmHg, latanoprost reduced <oc>IOP</oc> by <r1>6.7 mmHg</r1> (<r1>28%</r1>) and unoprostone reduced IOP by <r2>3.3 mmHg</r2> (<r2>14%</r2>). The difference between the groups of 3.4 mmHg was significant (P: &lt; 0.001, analysis of covariance; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -4.7 to -2.1) in favor of latanoprost. A &gt;/=30% reduction in mean IOP from baseline was achieved by 44% of latanoprost-treated patients compared with 8% of unoprostone-treated patients. The incidence of adverse events was low and comparable between the groups.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Latanoprost administered once daily was significantly more effective in reducing IOP compared with unoprostone administered twice daily in patients with POAG and OH.</abstracttext>
