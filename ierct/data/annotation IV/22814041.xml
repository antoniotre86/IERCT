<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To assess the long-term safety and efficacy of a single trabecular micro-bypass stent with concomitant cataract <a1>surgery</a1> versus cataract <a2>surgery</a2> alone for mild to moderate open-angle <p>glaucoma</p>.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="SETTING" nlmcategory="METHODS">Twenty-nine investigational sites, United States.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">Prospective randomized controlled multicenter clinical trial.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS"><p>Eyes</p> with mild to moderate glaucoma with an unmedicated intraocular pressure (IOP) of 22 mm Hg or higher and 36 mm Hg or lower were randomly assigned to have cataract <a1>surgery</a1> with iStent trabecular micro-bypass stent implantation (stent group) or cataract <a2>surgery</a2> alone (control group). Patients were followed for 24 months postoperatively.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">The incidence of adverse events was low in both groups through 24 months of follow-up. At 24 months, the proportion of patients with an IOP of 21 mm Hg or lower without ocular hypotensive medications was significantly higher in the stent group than in the control group (P=.036). Overall, the mean <oc>IOP</oc> was stable between 12 months and 24 months (<r1>17.0 mm Hg ± 2.8</r1> [SD] and 17.1 ± 2.9 mm Hg, respectively) in the stent group but increased (<r2>17.0 ± 3.1 mm Hg</r2> to 17.8 ± 3.3 mm Hg, respectively) in the control group. Ocular hypotensive medication was statistically significantly lower in the stent group at 12 months; it was also lower at 24 months, although the difference was no longer statistically significant.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Patients with combined single trabecular micro-bypass stent and cataract surgery had significantly better IOP control on no medication through 24 months than patients having cataract surgery alone. Both groups had a similar favorable long-term safety profile.</abstracttext>
