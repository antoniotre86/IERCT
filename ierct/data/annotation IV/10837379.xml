<abstracttext label="AIMS" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the effects on intraocular pressure (IOP) and side effects of monotherapy with either <a1>latanoprost</a1> or <a2>dorzolamide</a2> in <p>patients</p> with glaucoma or ocular hypertension.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">224 <p>patients</p> with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were recruited to a 3 month open labelled study. Previous glaucoma medications were washed out and the patients were randomised to receive either <a1>latanoprost</a1> 0.005% once daily or <a2>dorzolamide</a2> 2% three times daily.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Of 224 patients 213 were included in the analysis of efficacy. After 3 months, latanoprost reduced mean baseline diurnal <oc>IOP</oc> from 27.2 (SD 3.0) mm Hg by <r1>8.5 (3.3) mm Hg</r1>. The corresponding figures for dorzolamide were 27.2 (3.4) and <r2>5.6 (2.6) mm Hg</r2>. The difference of 2.9 mm Hg (95% CI: 2.3-3.6) was highly significant (p&lt;0.001, ANCOVA). Latanoprost reduced IOP at peak by 8.6 mm Hg (32%) compared with 6.2 mm Hg (23%) for dorzolamide, and the difference of 2.4 mm Hg was significant (p&lt;0.001, ANCOVA). The corresponding figures at trough were 8.1 mm Hg (31%) for latanoprost and 4.7 mm Hg (17%) for dorzolamide, a significant difference of 3.4 mm Hg (p&lt;0.001, ANCOVA). Both drugs were well tolerated systemically and locally.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Latanoprost was superior to dorzolamide in reducing the IOP, judged both from the effect on IOP at peak and trough and by the effect on diurnal IOP.</abstracttext>
