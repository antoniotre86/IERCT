<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the effect on intraocular pressure (IOP) of the silicone Ahmed glaucoma <a1>valve</a1> with and without an intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="PATIENTS AND METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">Forty-nine <p>patients</p> with clinically uncontrolled neovascular glaucoma were included in the study; 22 were randomly assigned to the study group (silicone Ahmed glaucoma valve <a1>implant</a1> with intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide) and 27 to the control group (silicone Ahmed glaucoma <a2>valve</a2>). IOP was the primary outcome measure in this study. The secondary outcome measure was success, defined by IOP lower than 22 mm Hg and higher than 5 mm Hg, and no serious complications. Success rates in both the groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the log-rank test. IOP levels were compared using mixed linear model analysis to correct for repeated measures correlation.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Forty-three patients, 18 in the study group and 25 in the control group, completed the study (follow-up of 12 mo). The mean IOP was significantly lower after 1 year in both the groups (P&lt;0.001). The mean <oc>IOP</oc> in the first month of follow-up was lower in the study group (control; <r2>20.4±9.7</r2>, study; <r1>13.6±6.5</r1>, P&lt;0.01). The success rate at 1 year was 78% for the study group and 76% for the control group (P=0.82). Complication rates were not different between the groups.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide in neovascular glaucoma did not affect the intermediate-term success of the silicone Ahmed valve nor reduce the incidence of complications. The mean IOP spike in the first month was lower in the triamcinolone group.</abstracttext>
