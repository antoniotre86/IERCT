<abstracttext label="AIMS" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To determine the analgesic effect of supplemental intracameral lidocaine 1% during phacoemulsification under topical anaesthesia, and to assess the risk factors associated with pain.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">In a double-masked, randomised, clinical trial, 506 <p>patients</p> undergoing phacoemulsification under topical anaesthesia were randomised to receive a supplemental intracameral injection of either 0.5 cc of 1% <a1>lidocaine</a1> (277 patients, 54.7%) or balanced salt <a2>solution</a2> (BSS) (229 patients, 45.3%). Patients were interviewed by a trained interviewer using a standardised questionnaire. The main outcome measure was intraoperative pain, scored on a visual analogue scale of 0-10. Logistic regression was performed to assess ORs.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS"><r1>125 of 277</r1> patients (<r1>45.1%</r1>) experienced <oc>pain</oc> in the lidocaine group, compared with <r2>123 of 229</r2> patients (<r2>53.7%</r2>) in the BSS group. The proportion of patients who experienced pain was significantly lower in the intracameral lidocaine group compared with the BSS group (multivariate OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.97; p=0.034). The median pain score (range) was 0.0 for intracameral lidocaine group compared with 1.0 for BSS group (p=0.039). Pain was more common in females (54.3% vs 43.6%; OR 1.56), non-Chinese (62.3% vs 46.9%; OR 2.13) and those who had previous cataract surgery to the fellow eye (55.3% vs 44.7%; OR 1.61).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">The use of 0.5 cc of 1% intracameral lidocaine during phacoemulsification under topical anaesthesia significantly reduces pain experienced by patients. Risk factors for pain include females, non-Chinese and previous cataract surgery.</abstracttext>
