<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the efficacy and safety of <a1>viscocanalostomy</a1> and <a2>trabeculectomy</a2> in <p>patients</p> with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="SETTING" nlmcategory="METHODS">Department of Ophthalmology, Ankara Education and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">In this prospective randomized trial, 50 eyes of 50 <p>patients</p> with medically uncontrolled POAG were randomized to have a <a2>trabeculectomy</a2> (25 eyes) or a <a1>viscocanalostomy</a1> (25 eyes). Visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP), and slitlamp examinations were performed before surgery and 1 day, 1 week, 1, 3, and 6 months, and 1, 2, and 3 years postoperatively.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">At 3 years, the mean <oc>IOP</oc> was <r2>16.0 mmHg +/- 7.07</r2> (SD) in the trabeculectomy group and <r1>17.8 +/- 4.6 mmHg</r1> in the viscocanalostomy group (P=.694). Complete success (IOP 6 to 21 mm Hg without medication) was achieved in 66.2% of eyes at 6 months and 55.1% at 3 years in the trabeculectomy group and in 52.9% and 35.3%, respectively, in the viscocanalostomy group (P&gt;.05). Qualified success (IOP 6 to 21 mmHg with medication) was achieved in 95.8% of eyes at 6 months and 79.2% at 3 years in the trabeculectomy group and in 90.7% and 73.9%, respectively, in the viscocanalostomy group (P&gt;.05). Postoperative hypotony and cataract formation occurred more frequently in the trabeculectomy group than in the viscocanalostomy group (P=.002).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Primary trabeculectomy lowered IOP more than viscocanalostomy in POAG patients. However, the complication rate was lower in the viscocanalostomy group.</abstracttext>
