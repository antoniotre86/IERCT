<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the efficacy and safety of topical <a1>bimatoprost</a1> (LUMIGAN; Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA) once daily with that of topical combined <a2>timolol</a2> and dorzolamide (Cosopt; Merck and Co, Inc., Whitehouse Station, NJ) twice daily.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">Prospective, randomized, double-masked, multicenter clinical trial.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="PARTICIPANTS" nlmcategory="METHODS">One hundred seventy-seven <p>patients</p> with a diagnosis of glaucoma or ocular hypertension and inadequate control of intraocular pressure (IOP) after at least 2 weeks of topical timolol maleate 0.5% monotherapy.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">Patients were randomized to receive <a1>bimatoprost</a1> 0.03% once daily (n = 90) or combined <a2>timolol</a2> 0.5% and dorzolamide 2% twice daily (n = 87) over a 3-month period.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES" nlmcategory="METHODS">Intraocular pressure, the primary end point, was measured at 8 AM and 10 AM at baseline, week 1, and months 1, 2, and 3, and also at 4 PM and 8 PM at baseline and month 3.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Bimatoprost provided significantly greater IOP lowering compared with combined timolol and dorzolamide. At the 8 AM measurements, bimatoprost lowered mean <oc>IOP</oc> <r1>6.8 mmHg to 7.6 mmHg</r1> from baseline, whereas combined timolol and dorzolamide lowered mean IOP <r2>4.4 to 5.0 mmHg</r2> from baseline (P&lt;0.001). At the last follow-up, patients had better diurnal IOP control with bimatoprost than combined timolol and dorzolamide. At 8 AM at the 3-month visit, the percentages of patients achieving IOPs of &lt;or =13 mmHg, &lt; or =14 mmHg, &lt; or =15 mmHg, or &lt; or =16 mmHg were more than twice as high for bimatoprost than for combined timolol and dorzolamide (all P&lt; or =0.008). Taste perversion, ocular burning, and stinging with instillation were more common with combined timolol and dorzolamide, whereas conjunctival hyperemia was more common with bimatoprost.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">In individuals with glaucoma or ocular hypertension, uncontrolled on a topical beta-blocker alone, bimatoprost lowered IOP more consistently than did combined timolol and dorzolamide.</abstracttext>
