<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the effect on intraocular pressure of <a1>latanoprost</a1> versus <a2>timolol</a2> plus dorzolamide in open-angle glaucoma.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">Thirty-five <p>patients</p> with open-angle glaucoma were randomized, 18 to <a1>latanoprost</a1> once daily and 17 to <a2>timolol</a2> plus dorzolamide twice daily. Intraocular pressure and ocular side effects were recorded at baseline, and after 2 weeks and 3 months of treatment.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Latanoprost reduced the intraocular pressure 1.09 and 1.58 mm Hg more than timolol plus dorzolamide after 2 weeks and 3 months of treatment, respectively. These differences were statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) at the end of the study. After 3 months of treatment, <r1>32.3%</r1> of the eyes in the latanoprost group reduced the intraocular <oc>pressure</oc> in 30% or more with respect to baseline, while <r2>15.6%</r2> of the eyes in the timolol plus dorzolamide group achieved this reduction.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Latanoprost administered once daily reduced the intraocular pressure at least as well as timolol plus dorzolamide twice daily in patients with open-angle glaucoma.</abstracttext>
