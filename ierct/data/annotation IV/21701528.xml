<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering efficacy of travoprost/timolol in a benzalkonium chloride (BAK)-free fixed <a1>combination</a1> preserved with polyquaternium-1 (TRA/TIM BAK-free), with travoprost/timolol-fixed <a2>combination</a2> preserved with BAK (TRA/TIM), in <p>patients</p> with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">In this prospective randomized controlled trial, <p>subjects</p> with IOP of at least 22 mm Hg in one or both eyes at 0900 h, and IOP of at least 21  mm Hg in one or both eyes at 1100  h and 1600  h at two eligibility visits were randomly assigned to receive either <a1>TRA/TIM</a1> BAK-free (n=195) or <a2>TRA/TIM</a2> (n=193), dosed once daily in the morning (0900  h) for 6 weeks. IOP was assessed at 0900  h, 1100  h, and 1600  h at each scheduled visit (baseline, 2 and 6 weeks after randomization).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Mean IOP <oc>reduction</oc> across all visits and time points was <r1>8.0 mm Hg</r1> in the TRA/TIM BAK-free group and <r2>8.4 mm Hg</r2> in the TRA/TIM group (P=0.0943). The difference in mean IOP between groups ranged from 0.2 to 0.7  mm Hg across visits and time points, with a mean pooled difference of 0.4  mm Hg (95% CI: -0.1 to 0.8), demonstrating equivalence of the two formulations. The most common drug-related adverse event was hyperemia of the eye (ocular hyperemia and conjunctival hyperemia combined), occurring in 11.8% of the TRA/TIM BAK-free group and 13.0% of the TRA/TIM group.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Travoprost/timolol BAK-free demonstrated equivalence to travoprost/timolol preserved with BAK in efficacy. No clinically relevant differences in the safety profiles of travoprost/timolol BAK-free and travoprost/timolol preserved with BAK were identified.</abstracttext>
