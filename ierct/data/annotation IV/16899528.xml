<abstracttext label="AIMS" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare selective laser <a1>trabeculoplasty</a1> (SLT) and argon laser <a2>trabeculoplasty</a2> (ALT), in terms of intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering, in <p>patients</p> with open-angle glaucoma.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">176 eyes of 152 patients were enrolled in this study, 89 in the SLT and 87 in the ALT groups. Patients were randomised to receive either <a1>SLT</a1> or <a2>ALT</a2> treatment to 180 degrees of the trabecular meshwork. Patients were followed up to 12 months after treatment. The main outcome measured was IOP lowering at 12 months after treatment, compared between the SLT and ALT groups.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">No significant difference (p = 0.846) was found in mean <oc>decrease</oc> in IOP between the SLT (<r1>5.86 mm Hg</r1>) and ALT (<r2>6.04 mm Hg</r2>) groups at 1 year or at any other time points, nor were there any significant differences in the rate of early or late complications between the two groups.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">SLT is equivalent to ALT in terms of IOP lowering at 1 year, and is a safe and effective procedure for patients with open-angle glaucoma.</abstracttext>
