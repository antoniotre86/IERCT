<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the intraocular pressure)-lowering effect and side effects of <a1>latanoprost</a1> 0.005% once daily with <a2>unoprostone</a2> 0.12% twice daily.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">Sixty <p>patients</p> with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomized to receive either <a1>latanoprost</a1> once daily in the evening and placebo once daily in the morning, or <a2>unoprostone</a2> twice daily in the morning and evening. The study was double masked and followed a crossover design with two treatment periods of 1 month separated by a 3-week washout period. The intraocular pressure was measured at 9 AM and 5 PM on the baseline and day 28 visits, and at 9 AM on day 2 and day 14 visits of each treatment period. The 9 AM measurement was taken 2 hours and 13 hours after the last drop of unoprostone and latanoprost, and the 5 PM measurement was at 10 and 21 hours, respectively. The mean of the measurements was calculated. Safety parameters were also recorded.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Fifty-six patients completed both treatment periods and had intraocular pressure data available for evaluation. After 1 month of treatment, latanoprost significantly reduced intraocular <oc>pressure</oc> (mean +/- SEM) by <r1>6.1 +/- 0.5 mm Hg</r1> (P &lt;.001) and unoprostone by <r2>4.2 +/- 0.4 mm Hg</r2> (P &lt;.001) adjusted from an overall baseline of 22.3 +/- 0.5 mm Hg and 23.2 +/- 0.4 mm Hg, respectively. The difference of 1.9 mm Hg between treatments was statistically significant in favor of latanoprost [P =.003, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)]. Unadjusted analysis of responders using the percentage decrease in intraocular pressure showed that the proportion of responders in the latanoprost-treated group was greater than in the unoprostone-treated group. Adverse ocular symptoms and findings were mild in both treatment groups. Eye redness and ocular irritation were the most frequently reported events.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Latanoprost once daily was significantly more effective in reducing intraocular pressure compared with unoprostone twice daily after 1 month of treatment in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Both drugs were well tolerated with few ocular adverse events.</abstracttext>
