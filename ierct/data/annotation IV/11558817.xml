<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the intraocular pressure-lowering effect of <a1>latanoprost</a1> with that of <a2>dorzolamide</a2> when added to timolol.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="PATIENTS AND METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">This randomized, open-label study with two parallel groups was conducted in five centers in Greece. The study enrolled 148 <p>patients</p> with inadequately controlled open-angle or pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (intraocular pressure of at least 22 mm Hg) or ocular hypertension (intraocular pressure of at least 27 mm Hg) who were receiving monotherapy with a beta-blocker or dual therapy in which one of the agents was a beta-blocker. The patients were switched to timolol 0.5% twice daily for 2 to 4 weeks (run-in period) before the start of the study (baseline). At baseline, the patients were randomized to receive <a1>latanoprost</a1> 0.005% once daily or <a2>dorzolamide</a2> 2% twice daily as add-on therapy to timolol. The intraocular pressure was recorded at 9:30 AM, 12:30 PM, and 3:30 PM at baseline and at 3 months. Safety was followed throughout the study.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">The diurnal intraocular pressure reduction was significant in both groups (P &lt; 0.001). The mean intraocular pressure <oc>reduction</oc> from baseline was <r1>32%</r1> for the latanoprost plus timolol group and <r2>20%</r2> for the dorzolamide plus timolol group. The least square estimate of the mean diurnal intraocular pressure reduction after 3 months was -7.06 mm Hg in the latanoprost plus timolol group and -4.44 mm Hg in the dorzolamide plus timolol group (P &lt; 0.001). Drugs administered in both treatment groups were well tolerated.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">This study clearly showed that the additive diurnal intraocular pressure-lowering effect of latanoprost is superior to that of dorzolamide in patients treated with timolol.</abstracttext>
