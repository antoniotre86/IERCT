<abstracttext label="BACKGROUND" nlmcategory="BACKGROUND">trabeculectomy is the standard surgical procedure for management of glaucoma.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="OBJECTIVE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">to compare the outcome of triangular and rectangular scleral flaps in trabeculectomy.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="MATERIALS AND METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">this study was carried out in the Department ofOphthalmology, BPKIHS, Dharan, over a period of one year. A total of 22 <p>patients</p> undergoing trabeculectomy were randomized to undergo either <a1>trabeculectomy</a1> with triangular scleral flap (Group A= 11 eyes) or <a2>trabeculectomy</a2> with rectangular flap (Group B = 11 eyes).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="OUTCOME MEASUREMENT" nlmcategory="METHODS">the parameters studied were intraocular pressure (IOP), anterior chamber depth (ACD), bleb characteristics and surgical complications.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="STATISTICS" nlmcategory="METHODS">P value of&lt;0.05 was considered significant. All calculations were executed using SPSS 11.0 software program.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">the age ranged between 40 to 76 years with the mean of 56.5 +/- 9.25 years. The most common preoperative diagnosis was angle closure glaucoma. The postoperative percentage of IOP <oc>reduction</oc> (Group A <r1>68.9%</r1>; Group B <r2>66.51%</r2>) was statically significant in both the groups (p=0.001). Trabeculectomy was almost equally effective with complete surgical success of 91% in group A, and 82% in group B (p=0.534). Final bleb scores were almost similar in both the groups with 3.27 +/- 1.5 in group A and 3.36 +/- 1.21 in group B (p=0.877). Hypotony with the IOP less than 6 mmHg was found in the first post-operative day in 2 patients in Group A and in 1 in Group B. All of them improved spontaneously within a week.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">both triangular and rectangular scleral flaps in trabeculectomy are equally effective in terms of post surgical IOP control, bleb characteristics and complications.</abstracttext>
