<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To investigate risk factors associated with visual field progression in the Low-pressure Glaucoma Treatment Study, a prospective trial designed to compare the effects of the alpha2-adrenergic agonist <a1>brimonidine</a1> tartrate 0.2% to the beta-adrenergic antagonist <a2>timolol</a2> maleate 0.5% on visual function in low-pressure <p>glaucoma</p>.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">Prospective cohort study.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">Low-pressure Glaucoma Treatment Study patients with ≥5 visual field tests during follow-up were included. <oc>Progression</oc> was determined using pointwise linear regression analysis, defined as the same 3 or more visual field locations with a slope more negative than -1.0 dB/year at P &lt; 5%, on 3 consecutive tests. Ocular and systemic risk factors were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards model and further tested for independence in a multivariate model.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">A total of 253 eyes of 127 subjects (mean age, 64.7  10.9 years; mean follow-up, 40.6  12 months) were analyzed. Eyes randomized to timolol progressed faster than those randomized to brimonidine (mean rates of progression, <r1>-0.38</r1>  0.9 vs <r2>0.02</r2>  0.7 dB/y, P &lt; .01). In the final multivariate model adjusting for all tested covariates, older age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.41/decade older, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05 to 1.90, P = .022), use of systemic antihypertensives (HR = 2.53, 95% CI = 1.32 to 4.87, P = .005), and mean ocular perfusion pressure (HR = 1.21/mm Hg lower, 95% CI = 1.12 to 1.31, P &lt; .001) were associated with progression whereas randomization to brimonidine revealed a protective effect (HR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.12 to 0.55, P &lt; .001).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">While randomization to brimonidine 0.2% was protective compared to timolol 0.5%, lower mean ocular perfusion pressure increased the risk for reaching a progression outcome in the Low-pressure Glaucoma Treatment Study. This suggests that the beneficial effect of randomization to the brimonidine arm was independent of possible differences in ocular perfusion pressures between the 2 treatment arms. The current results and large number of drop-outs in the brimonidine 0.2% arm suggest that more research is necessary before altering clinical practice paradigms.</abstracttext>
