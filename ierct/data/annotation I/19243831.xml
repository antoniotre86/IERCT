<abstracttext label="OBJECTIVE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare <a1>phacoemulsification</a1> alone versus combined <a2>phacotrabeculectomy</a2> in medically uncontrolled chronic angle closure glaucoma (CACG) with coexisting cataract.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">Prospective randomized clinical trial.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="PARTICIPANTS" nlmcategory="METHODS">Fifty-one medically uncontrolled CACG <p>eyes</p> with coexisting cataract of 51 patients.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="INTERVENTION" nlmcategory="METHODS">Recruited patients were randomized into group 1 (phacoemulsification alone) or group 2 (combined phacotrabeculectomy with adjunctive mitomycin C). Postoperatively, patients were reviewed every 3 months for 2 years.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES" nlmcategory="METHODS">Intraocular <oc>pressure</oc> (IOP) and requirement for topical glaucoma drugs.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Twenty-seven CACG eyes were randomized into group 1, and 24 CACG eyes were randomized into group 2. Combined phacotrabeculectomy resulted in lower mean postoperative IOP than phacoemulsification alone at 3 months (<r1>14.0</r1> vs <r2>17.0 mmHg</r2>, P = 0.01), 15 months (13.2 vs 15.4 mmHg, P = 0.02), and 18 months (13.6 vs 15.9 mmHg, P = 0.01). Combined phacotrabeculectomy resulted in 1.25 fewer topical glaucoma drugs (P&lt;0.001) in the 24-month postoperative period, compared with phacoemulsification alone. Combined surgery was associated with more postoperative complications (P&lt;0.001) and more progression of optic neuropathy (P = 0.03), compared with phacoemulsification alone.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Combined phacotrabeculectomy with adjunctive mitomycin C is more effective than phacoemulsification alone in controlling IOP in medically uncontrolled CACG eyes with coexisting cataract. Combined phacotrabeculectomy is associated with more postoperative complications.</abstracttext>
