<abstracttext label="OBJECTIVE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of augmenting trabeculectomy with subconjunctival <a1>mitomycin</a1> C (TMMC) versus <a2>5-fluorouracil</a2> (T5-FU) in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">Forty eyes from 40 patients referred to the Nikoukari Ophthalmology University Hospital, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran, were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial. <p>Patients</p> with high-risk open angle glaucoma were allocated to receive either subconjunctival TMMC or T5-FU.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Mean overall preoperative IOP was 30.8 mmHg. Mean preoperative IOPs in the TMMC and T5-FU groups were 31.2 ± 9.8 and 30.6 ± 9.9 mmHg, respectively. Postoperatively, mean <oc>IOPs</oc> were <r1>11.4.3 ± 4.9</r1> and <r2>13.6 ± 3.9 mmHg</r2>, respectively for TMMC and T5-FU groups after 6 months. In spite of some existing descriptive differences in IOP between the groups, statistical tests showed no difference in mean and median IOP. Three cases of hypotonia (IOP &lt; 6 mmHg) and 1 case of epithelial keratitis were detected.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">TMMC and T5-FU appeared to have similar efficacy in lowering IOP.</abstracttext>
