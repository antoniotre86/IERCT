<abstracttext label="OBJECTIVE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To evaluate the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering efficacy and safety of fixed-<a1>combination</a1> brimonidine 0.2%-timolol 0.5% compared with <a2>latanoprost</a2> 0.005% in <p>patients</p> with glaucoma or ocular hypertension.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">This was a prospective, randomized, multicenter, investigator-masked clinical trial. After washout of any previous IOP-lowering medications, patients with IOP of 24 mmHg or higher were randomized to twice-daily fixed-combination brimonidine 0.2%-timolol 0.5% (n = 73) or once-daily latanoprost 0.005% (n = 75, dosed in the evening, with vehicle control in the morning to maintain masking) for 12 weeks. IOP was measured at 8 a.m. (before dosing), 10 a.m., and 3 p.m. at baseline, week 6, and week 12.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION" nlmcategory="BACKGROUND">The trial is registered with the identifier 00811564 at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov .</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES" nlmcategory="METHODS">The primary efficacy endpoint was diurnal <oc>IOP</oc> (averaged over 8 a.m., 10 a.m., and 3 p.m.) at week 12. Safety measures included biomicroscopy.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups in mean diurnal IOP at baseline (p = 0.118). At week 12, the mean (SD) diurnal IOP was <r1>17.8 (2.9) mmHg</r1> with brimonidine-timolol and <r2>17.9 (3.9) mmHg</r2> with latanoprost (p = 0.794). The percentage of patients achieving at least a 20% decrease from baseline diurnal IOP at week 12 was 87.7% in the brimonidine-timolol group and 77.3% in the latanoprost group (p = 0.131). Measured biomicroscopic changes from baseline to week 12 were infrequent in both groups.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Fixed-combination brimonidine-timolol was as effective as latanoprost in reducing IOP in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Both treatments demonstrated favorable ocular tolerability. The duration of the study was 12 weeks, and additional studies will be needed to compare the efficacy and safety of fixed-combination brimonidine-timolol and latanoprost during long-term treatment.</abstracttext>
