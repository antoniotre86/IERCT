<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effect of combined <a1>viscocanalostomy</a1> and phacoemulsification and combined <a2>trabeculectomy</a2> and phacoemulsification with mitomycin C in <p>eyes</p> with primary open-angle glaucoma.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">Prospective randomized 1-year trial.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="PARTICIPANTS" nlmcategory="METHODS">Forty consecutive patients (40 eyes) with primary open-angle glaucoma and cataract.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="INTERVENTION" nlmcategory="METHODS">Eyes were assigned randomly either to trabeculectomy with mitomycin C or to viscocanalostomy in combination with phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES" nlmcategory="METHODS">Success rate based on <oc>IOP</oc>.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Mean baseline IOP was 24.0+/-2.0 mmHg in the viscocanalostomy group and 23.7+/-2.6 mmHg in the trabeculectomy group (P = 0.7). Mean postoperative IOP was <r1>13.7+/-2.2 mmHg</r1> at 3 months, 14.8+/-3.3 mmHg at 6 months, and 14.9+/-3.0 mmHg at 12 months in the viscocanalostomy group and <r2>12.1+/-4.0 mmHg</r2> at 3 months, 13.8+/-4.7 mmHg at 6 months, and 14.1+/-4.4 mmHg at 12 months in the trabeculectomy group. There was no significant difference in the mean IOP between the groups at any time. At 12 months, 17 patients (85%) in the viscocanalostomy group and 16 patients (80%) in the trabeculectomy group achieved an IOP of 20 mmHg or less without medication (P = 0.7). Complications included 2 cases (10%) of flat/shallow anterior chamber and 4 cases (20%) of hypotony in the trabeculectomy group, whereas intraoperative microperforation of Descemet's membrane occurred in 3 cases (15%) in the viscocanalostomy group.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">There was no significant difference in IOP reduction between viscocanalostomy and trabeculectomy with mitomycin C in combination with phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma.</abstracttext>
