<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the clinical success rates and quality of life impact of <a1>brimonidine</a1> 0.2% with <a2>timolol</a2> 0.5% in newly diagnosed patients naive to glaucoma therapy.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">A prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, clinical effectiveness trial in which the clinical outcomes of twice daily brimonidine tartrate 0.2% were compared with those of timolol maleate 0.5% in <p>patients</p> with glaucoma and ocular hypertension was conducted. Two hundred nineteen patients were enrolled--111 in the brimonidine group and 108 in the timolol group. Patients instilled their study medications twice daily for 4 months. Factors for determining clinical success were <oc>reduction</oc> of intraocular pressure (IOP), safety, and adverse events. Quality of life effects were assessed with the SF-36 Health Survey and Glaucoma Disability Index questionnaires.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Clinical success was <r1>71%</r1> (75/106) with brimonidine and <r2>70%</r2> (73/105) with timolol as initial treatment. The overall mean decrease in IOP was 6.5 mm Hg with brimonidine and 6.2 mm Hg with timolol. Few patients reported a specific adverse event and, with the exception of a slightly higher rate of ocular burning and stinging in the brimonidine group, there were no significant between-group differences. No significant chronotropic effects on the heart were seen with brimonidine, while small but significant mean decreases in heart rate were seen at months 1 and 4 with timolol. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure remained relatively stable in both groups. Quality of life remained stable, with no significant between-group differences.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">As a first-line agent for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension, brimonidine has clinical effectiveness equivalent to timolol, but with less chronotropic effect on the heart. Brimonidine is a viable alternative to timolol for first-line therapy in glaucoma and ocular hypertension.</abstracttext>
