<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the intraocular pressure)-lowering effect and side effects of <a1>latanoprost</a1> 0.005% once daily with <a2>unoprostone</a2> 0.12% twice daily.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">Sixty <p>patients</p> with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomized to receive either latanoprost once daily in the evening and placebo once daily in the morning, or unoprostone twice daily in the morning and evening. The study was double masked and followed a crossover design with two treatment periods of 1 month separated by a 3-week washout period. The intraocular <oc>pressure</oc> was measured at 9 AM and 5 PM on the baseline and day 28 visits, and at 9 AM on day 2 and day 14 visits of each treatment period. The 9 AM measurement was taken 2 hours and 13 hours after the last drop of unoprostone and latanoprost, and the 5 PM measurement was at 10 and 21 hours, respectively. The mean of the measurements was calculated. Safety parameters were also recorded.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Fifty-six patients completed both treatment periods and had intraocular pressure data available for evaluation. After 1 month of treatment, latanoprost significantly reduced intraocular pressure (mean +/- SEM) by <r1>6.1 +/- 0.5 mm Hg</r1> (P &lt;.001) and unoprostone by <r2>4.2 +/- 0.4 mm Hg</r2> (P &lt;.001) adjusted from an overall baseline of 22.3 +/- 0.5 mm Hg and 23.2 +/- 0.4 mm Hg, respectively. The difference of 1.9 mm Hg between treatments was statistically significant in favor of latanoprost [P =.003, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)]. Unadjusted analysis of responders using the percentage decrease in intraocular pressure showed that the proportion of responders in the latanoprost-treated group was greater than in the unoprostone-treated group. Adverse ocular symptoms and findings were mild in both treatment groups. Eye redness and ocular irritation were the most frequently reported events.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Latanoprost once daily was significantly more effective in reducing intraocular pressure compared with unoprostone twice daily after 1 month of treatment in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Both drugs were well tolerated with few ocular adverse events.</abstracttext>
