<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Baerveldt and Ahmed glaucoma drainage implants in Asian <p>patients</p> with refractory glaucoma.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">Retrospective nonrandomized study.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="PARTICIPANTS" nlmcategory="METHODS">Forty-one patients.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">The authors reviewed the insertion of 18 Ahmed glaucoma valved (AGV-S2) <a1>implants</a1> and 24 350 mm(2) Baerveldt glaucoma <a2>implants</a2> performed by a single surgeon at the Department of Ophthalmology, National University Hospital, Singapore, from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2000. A total of 42 glaucoma drainage implants was inserted into the eyes of 41 patients. All patients had at least 6 months of follow-up.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES" nlmcategory="METHODS">Intraocular <oc>pressure</oc> (IOP), visual acuity, and complications.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Both drainage implants achieved remarkable reductions in IOP; from pretreatment IOP of 40.1+/-13.8 mmHg and 43.7+/-9.3 mmHg to postoperative IOP of <r2>17.4+/-6.2</r2> and <r1>14.9+/-5.5 mmHg</r1> in the Baerveldt and Ahmed groups, respectively. A decrease in IOP of 56.6% and 65.9% had been achieved. Success rates were 20 (83.3%) for Baerveldt and 12 (66.7%) for Ahmed implants, whereas qualified success occurred in 1 (4.2%) Baerveldt and 3 (16.7%) Ahmed implants. Conversely, failure to control IOP occurred in 3 (12.5%) Baerveldt implants and 3 (16.7%) Ahmed implants. More than 80% of the patients had maintained or improved visual function, whereas only 4 (16.0%) of the patients with Baerveldt implants and 2 (16.7%) patients with Ahmed implants had loss of more than 1 Snellen line.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Both Baerveldt and Ahmed glaucoma drainage implants performed well in terms of IOP control, preservation of visual function, and having low complication rates.</abstracttext>
