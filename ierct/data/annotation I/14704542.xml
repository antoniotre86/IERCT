<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the efficacy of intraocular pressure (IOP) control of the Baerveldt-350 <a1>implant</a1> with tube ligature and the Ahmed <a2>valve</a2> in <p>patients</p> with refractory glaucoma.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="PATIENTS AND METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">Four hundred seventy glaucoma drainage device procedures from July 1995 to July 2001 (6 years) were reviewed retrospectively. Thirty-two cases of Baerveldt-350 implantation performed in patients with glaucoma refractory to medical treatment and filtering procedures, without previous drainage device or cyclodestructive procedures, and with a minimum of 1-year follow-up were identified. Thirty-two cases of Ahmed valve implantation were matched case by case with 32 Baerveldt-350 cases for age, race, gender, glaucoma subtype, previous ocular history, preoperative IOP, and surgeon who performed the implantation. The two groups were compared for IOP <oc>control</oc>, visual outcome, complication rate, and surgical success rate. Surgical success rate was defined as an IOP reduction greater than or equal to 30% and final IOP more than 5 mm Hg and less than 22 mm Hg, without devastating complications.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Over a follow-up period of 1 year, no statistically significant differences were detected between the Baerveldt-350 implant versus Ahmed valve for IOP control (<r1>12.1 +/- 5.3 mm Hg</r1> vs <r2>13.6 +/- 5.6 mm Hg</r2> respectively, at a power of 90% to detect a difference of 3.2 mm Hg between the two groups and P = 0.05), surgical success rate (65.6% vs. 65.6% respectively, complete and qualified combined), postoperative hypotony rate (37.5% vs. 34.4% respectively), and visual acuity changes of more than 1 line in Snellen visual acuity (43.3% vs. 29.0% respectively).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">In a case-controlled comparison, the Baerveldt-350 implant and the Ahmed valve had similar IOP control and surgical outcomes in patients with refractory glaucoma at 1-year follow-up.</abstracttext>
