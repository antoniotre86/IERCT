<abstracttext label="OBJECTIVE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To assess the safety and efficacy of the iStent trabecular micro-bypass stent (Glaukos Corporation, Laguna Hills, CA) in combination with cataract surgery in subjects with mild to moderate open-angle glaucoma.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">Prospective, randomized, open-label, controlled, multicenter clinical trial.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="PARTICIPANTS" nlmcategory="METHODS">A total of 240 <p>eyes</p> with mild to moderate open-angle glaucoma with intraocular pressure (IOP) =24 mmHg controlled on 1 to 3 medications were randomized to undergo cataract <a1>surgery</a1> with iStent implantation (treatment group) or cataract <a2>surgery</a2> only (control). Fifty additional subjects were enrolled to undergo cataract surgery with iStent implantation under protocol expansion. Data in this report are based on the first 240 eyes enrolled.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="INTERVENTION" nlmcategory="METHODS">Implantation of the iStent trabecular micro-bypass stent in conjunction with cataract surgery or cataract surgery only.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES" nlmcategory="METHODS">The primary efficacy measure was unmedicated <oc>IOP</oc> ≤21 mmHg at 1 year. A secondary measure was unmedicated IOP reduction ≥20% at 1 year. Safety measures included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), slit-lamp observations, complications, and adverse events.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">The study met the primary outcome, with <r1>72%</r1> of treatment eyes versus <r2>50%</r2> of control eyes achieving the criterion (P&lt;0.001). At 1 year, IOP in both treatment groups was statistically significantly lower from baseline values. Sixty-six percent of treatment eyes versus 48% of control eyes achieved =20% IOP reduction without medication (P = 0.003). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar between groups with no unanticipated adverse device effects.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Pressure reduction on fewer medications was clinically and statistically significantly better 1 year after stent plus cataract surgery versus cataract surgery alone, with an overall safety profile similar to that of cataract surgery alone.</abstracttext>
