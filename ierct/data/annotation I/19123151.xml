<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare the efficacy and tolerability of a once-daily evening dose of bimatoprost/timolol fixed <a1>combination</a1> (BTFC) with that of a once-daily evening dose of latanoprost/timolol fixed <a2>combination</a2> (LTFC) in <p>patients</p> not controlled with prostaglandins analogues monotherapy.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">A total of 82 patients on prostaglandin analogues monotherapy were enrolled in this prospective, multicenter, investigator masked, clinical study and were randomized to either BTFC (n=47) or LTFC (n=35) topical therapy once at night for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study was to compare the mean daily intraocular pressure (IOP) <oc>reduction</oc> from baseline between the two treatment arms. Secondary endpoints included the mean daily IOP at 1 and 3 months compared to baseline and the percentage of patients showing a mean IOP reduction from baseline greater than or equal to 15% or 20%.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Mean IOP at baseline was 22.7+/-2.0 and 22.1+/-2.6 mmHg in the BTFC and LTFC groups, respectively (p=0.23). Both treatments were effective in reducing the IOP from baseline. The mean IOP reduction was significantly greater in the BTFC group than in the LTFC group (<r1>-21.4%</r1> vs <r2>-13.7%</r2>, p&lt;0.001). A higher percentage of patients in the BTFC group showed a mean IOP reduction from baseline &gt;or=15% (72.3% vs 40.0%) and &gt;or=20% (61.7% vs 17.1%) compared to patients in the LTFC group.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Both BTFC and LTFC were more effective versus the monotherapy with prostaglandin analogues. BTFC demonstrated higher performance than LTFC in terms of relative IOP reduction.</abstracttext>
