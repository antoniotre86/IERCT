<abstracttext label="BACKGROUND/AIMS" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To compare two intraocular irrigating solutions, Balanced Salt <a1>Solution</a1> Plus (BSS Plus) versus Lactated <a2>Ringer's</a2> (Ringer), for the preservation of corneal integrity after phacoemulsification.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">110 <p>patients</p> undergoing phacoemulsification were randomised to either BSS Plus (n=55) or Ringer (n=55) as the irrigating solution. Patients were examined at baseline and at 1, 8, 15, 30 and 60 days postoperatively. Evaluations included specular microscopy to evaluate endothelial cell <oc>density</oc> (ECD) and endothelial cell size variability (CV), and corneal pachymetry for central corneal thickness (CCT) measurement.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Groups were well balanced regarding baseline ECD, CV and CCT (p&gt;0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between ECD reduction in group BSS Plus <r1>13.1 Â± 2.0%</r1> and Ringer <r2>9.2 Â± 1.9%</r2> (p&lt;0.05) at day 60 or in any study visit. There was no statistically significant difference between CV increase in group BSS Plus 23.0 Â± 3.0% and Ringer 20.2 Â± 4.0% (p&lt;0.05) at day 60 or in any study visit. CCT was significantly increased (p&lt;0.05) at 1, 8, 15 and 30 days postoperatively, returning to baseline at 60 days in both groups. There was no significant difference in CCT increase in both groups at any visit. Interestingly, there were statistically significant correlations between ECD loss and phacoemulsification time (p&lt;0.0001) and ECD loss and irrigation solution volume (p&lt;0.0001) in the Ringer group, but not in the BSS Plus group.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Ringers solution was similar to BSS Plus for corneal preservation in atraumatic cataract surgery. However, our study demonstrates that there is a trend towards lower postoperative endothelial cell density for surgeries with longer phacoemulsification time and higher irrigation volumes if Ringer is used.
