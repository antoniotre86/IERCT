<abstracttext>In a randomized clinical trial, the authors compared the use of postoperative subconjunctival injections of <a1>5-fluorouracil</a1> (5-FU) in 19 eyes with a single intraoperative application of subconjunctival <a2>mitomycin</a2> (MMC) at the filtering site in 20 <p>eyes</p> at high risk for failure of glaucoma filtering surgery. Six months after surgery, intraocular <oc>pressures</oc> averaged <r1>10.9 +/- 5.3 mmHg</r1> (mean +/- standard deviation) in the MMC-treated eyes versus <r2>14.2 +/- 5.5 mmHg</r2> in the 5-FU-treated eyes (P = 0.08) and were less than or equal to 12 mmHg in 60.0% of MMC-treated eyes and 21.1% of 5-FU-treated eyes (P = 0.03). Mitomycin-treated eyes were receiving an average of 0.3 +/- 0.5 medications for intraocular pressure control, and 5-FU-treated eyes were receiving an average of 1.1 +/- 1.1 medications (P = 0.01). Drug-induced corneal epithelial defects were seen in nine 5-FU-treated eyes and in no MMC-treated eyes (P = 0.0004). These results suggest that intraoperative MMC may be a viable alternative to postoperative 5-FU, with lower overall intraocular pressures, decreased dependence on postoperative ocular antihypertensive medications, and decreased corneal toxicity.</abstracttext>
