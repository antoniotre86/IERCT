<abstracttext label="BACKGROUND" nlmcategory="BACKGROUND">Approximately 40% of patients with glaucoma are concomitantly prescribed &gt;or=2 different intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering medications. An effective and well-tolerated fixed combination of agents requiring once-daily instillation may improve patient compliance.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="OBJECTIVE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety profile of the fixed <a1>combination</a1> latanoprost 0.005% + timolol maleate 0.5% QD with those of latanoprost 0.005% <a2>monotherapy</a2> QD in patients whose elevated IOP (&gt;or=21 mm Hg) was inadequately controlled by latanoprost.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">This 21-day, randomized, double-masked, active-control study was conducted at 49 study sites in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, the United States, and Venezuela. <p>Adults</p> with glaucoma or ocular hypertension who had failed to reach an IOP of &lt;21 mm Hg while receiving latanoprost for at least 28 days were enrolled. After an additional 28 days of latanoprost run-in, patients were randomly assigned to continue latanoprost monotherapy or to switch to the fixed combination for 21 days. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all patients who received at least 1 dose of double-masked study medication; the per-protocol (PP) analysis included patients who completed the study without a major protocol violation and who had IOP measurements both at baseline and at day 21. The primary end point was the <oc>proportion</oc> of patients whose IOP was decreased &gt;or=2 mm Hg from the baseline level on day 21. Proportions of patients demonstrating IOP decreases &gt;or=3, &gt;or=4, or &gt;or=5 mm Hg from the baseline level and of patients reaching an 10P &lt;or=18 mm Hg were evaluated. Adverse events (AEs) were also assessed.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">A total of 350 patients were enrolled. In all, 348 patients were included in the ITT and tolerability analyses (fixed combination, n = 175; latanoprost, n = 173; mean [SD] age, 64.4 [13.2] and 63.2 [14.0] years, respectively; 103 women in each group). Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between groups. A higher percentage of patients receiving the fixed combination had IOP decreases of 2 mm Hg on day 21 relative to baseline compared with latanoprost-treated patients (<r1>79.4%</r1> vs <r2>51.4%</r2>, respectively; P &lt; 0.001). PP analyses found that more patients in the fixed-combination group had IOP decreases &gt;or=3, &gt;or=4, or &gt;or=5 mm Hg (for each target level, P &lt; 0.001 vs latanoprost group) or final IOP 18 mm Hg (fixed -combination, 35.1%; latanoprost, 17.8%; P &lt; 0.001). Both treatments were well tolerated. Similar proportions of patients in the fixed-combination and latanoprost groups reported at least 1 treatment-emergent AE (10.9% and 12.1%, respectively).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSION" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">In this selected population of patients with an inadequate initial IOP response to latanoprost, switching to fixed-combination latanoprosttimolol resulted in a greater decrease in IOP and similar tolerability compared with continuing latanoprost therapy.</abstracttext>
