<abstracttext label="PURPOSE" nlmcategory="OBJECTIVE">To report one-year results of the Tube Versus Trabeculectomy (TVT) Study.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="DESIGN" nlmcategory="METHODS">Multicenter randomized clinical trial.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">Setting: 17 Clinical Centers. Study Population: <p>Patients</p> 18 to 85 years of age who had previous trabeculectomy and/or cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation and uncontrolled glaucoma with intraocular pressure (IOP) &gt; or =18 mm Hg and &lt; or =40 mm Hg on maximum tolerated medical therapy. Interventions: 350 mm(2) Baerveldt glaucoma <a1>implant</a1> or <a2>trabeculectomy</a2> with mitomycin C (MMC). Main Outcome Measures: <oc>IOP</oc>, visual acuity, and reoperation for glaucoma.</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">A total of 212 eyes of 212 patients were enrolled, including 107 in the tube group and 105 in the trabeculectomy group. At one year, IOP (mean +/- SD) was <r1>12.4 +/- 3.9 mm Hg</r1> in the tube group and <r2>12.7 +/- 5.8 mm Hg</r2> in the trabeculectomy group (P = .73). The number of glaucoma medications (mean +/- SD) was 1.3 +/- 1.3 in the tube group and 0.5 +/- 0.9 in the trabeculectomy group (P &lt; .001). The cumulative probability of failure during the first year of follow-up was 3.9% in the tube group and 13.5% in the trabeculectomy group (P = .017).</abstracttext>
<abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">Nonvalved tube shunt surgery was more likely to maintain IOP control and avoid persistent hypotony or reoperation for glaucoma than trabeculectomy with MMC during the first year of follow-up in the TVT Study. Both surgical procedures produced similar IOP reduction at one year, but there was less need for supplemental medical therapy following trabeculectomy with MMC.</abstracttext>
